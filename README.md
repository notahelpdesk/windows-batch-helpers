# Windows Batch File Helpers

# Introduction
This is a collection of batch files intended to make life in the command prompt easier.

A lot of these are focused around what I develop and how.

## General helpers
* `addpath.bat` Adds a directory to the path
* `clean.bat` This removes files generated by some of the build processes
* `clean-everything.bat` This removes more than clean.bat does
* `edge.bat` This opens up Microsoft Edge with the supplied URL
* `npp.bat` Opens the supplied file(s) in Notepad++

## Development-related helpers
* `coverage-template.bat` This is not designed to be used directly, but to be copied, modified used within repositories
* `set-coverage-and-tests-on.bat` This is intended to work with a `coverage.bat` file (see *coverage-template.bat*) and will open both unit test and code coverage reports
* `set-coverage-on.bat` This is like the one above, but is designed so that only open the coverage report will be opened by `coverage.bat`
* `terratest.bat` Intended for running Terratest tests inside a Docker container
* `unsetazure.bat` The terratest.bat depends on a few environment variables to be set. However, these prevent Terraform from working on the command line, so this addresses that problem

## Git-related helpers
* `checkout-default.bat` This changes the existing branch to the default branch. As this was designed with Git-Flow in mind, if the default branch is *master* then it checks out *develop* instead
* `current-branches.bat` This displays the current branch for every repository found below the current directory
* `get-all-remotes.bat` Similar to current-branches but displays all of the remote URLs. This assumes the remote is called 'origin'
* `gitprune.bat` This updates the codebase and displays any branches that have been removed
* `update-all.bat` Updates all of the checked-out repositories below the current directory
